 Weather Dashboard
 Version 1.0

 This application is a weather dashboard that requires the user to input a City name. The app will display the current temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed, and UV index of the specified city. It will also display a 5-day forcast. The weather data is pulled using the OpenWeather API. The application should also be able to save the users inputed cities into local storage.
